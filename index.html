				<p>
					My name is Tarun Boddupalli, and I'm a 14 year old freelance programmer and web developer. I'm currently in 9th grade, and I plan to study Computer Science once I graduate high school. My other hobbies include playing video games, listening to music (mostly dubstep), and astronomy. This is my website, where I post my latest projects and creations.
					<br><br>
					Most of my projects are just desktop applications that I've created to make my life a little bit easier. With that said, most of the things you'll find here may not be too useful for you. But if you're interested, you can download them and they'll work on any OS (thanks to Java).
					<br><br>
					I try to make my software available to as many people as possible, as well as supply the source of them so other people can learn from it. Even this website is open source. My software is completely safe to download, and if you feel suspicious, you can checkout the source code of my applications on GitHub.

					<h2>Web Skills</h2><br>
					<p>
						When I started programming, I tried HTML. I kind of drifted away from it and came back a couple of years later. I've improved my skills from then, and I coded this website <em>from scratch</em>. I have about 3 years of experience with my web skills (HTML/CSS/JS).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-4">
					<h2>Java</h2><br>
					<p>
						Right after experimenting with HTML, I tried some desktop programming. Java seemed like the right way to go, and it is still my favorite language to write in. I use it for desktop as well as android projects. I've made quite a few projects in it, and plan to make more.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-4">
					<h2>C++</h2><br>
					<p>
						Sometimes, Java just doesn't do the trick. Although it's good for its cross-platform-ness, I occasionally find myself needing to go deeper into a specific OS. C++ is a good tool for that, although I don't prefer the language.
					</p>

					<h2>Python</h2><br>
					<p>
						Probably my favorite language, I've been programming in Python for about a year now. I absolutely love how cross-platform it is and how easy it is to do complicated tasks. Although I don't have any major projects written in Python at the moment, I plan to use the language a lot more in my future.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-4">
					<h2>Swift</h2><br>
					<p>
						I've also started learning Swift, the new programming language made by Apple for iOS. Objective-C didn't seem too friendly to me, but Swift sure is. Once I become part of the iOS developer program, I plan to make many apps, for my benefit as well as for others.
